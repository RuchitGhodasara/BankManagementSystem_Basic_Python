Heet Dedakiya and I worked on a project Bank Management System using Python. That was in our first semester so, it is a rudimentary work. But, we learnt interconnected function call and challenges when all these lies in different files. We learnt basic of reading and writing CSV files. And also discussed problems with our approach that is data handling, solution of the same led to us to the base of DBMS.
